- [Apple's Declaration of Values: Simplify, Perfect, Delight - John Paczkowski - News - AllThingsD](https://allthingsd.com/20130611/apples-declaration-of-values-simplify-perfect-delight/)

- “The first thing we ask is: What do we want people to feel? Delight. Surprise. Love. Connection. Then we begin to craft around our intention. It takes time. There are a thousand no’s for every yes. We simplify. We perfect. We start over. Until everything we touch enhances each life it touches. Only then do we sign our work.”
