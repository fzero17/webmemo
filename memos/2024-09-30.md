  - **Content**: 雷打不动的真理，要想瘦还得饿。憋再整其他啥没用的研究了。新加坡国立大学教授何鼎荣（45岁）为了验证“代谢开关”（metabolic switch）理论，以自己为研究对象，进行了为期7个月的自我试验。通过监测血糖、血脂和体脂率等生物数据，他发现运动虽然重要，但如果饮食不加节制，代谢调整仍然难以启动。他在过去这几个月内，严格遵守每日一餐，断食20小时，只喝黑咖啡和白水，在可以吃的4小时内也只吃绿叶蔬菜、种籽、橄榄油、瘦肉蛋白、地中海饮食中常见食物和维生素，不吃碳水化合物和含糖食物，同时严格健身。谁能坚持照做保准瘦！我保证！

  - **Content**: Starting at the age of 12, I was given $20 a week for my food. (If it was a good week. Otherwise it might $10 or even $0). During the school year that meant I just had to make that stretch for dinner and the weekends — I had free school lunch. But in the summer, that made things quite a bit harder. One week, I had only a few jars of sprinkles left in the top of our pantry.

  - **Content**: I grew up relatively poor. I was fortunate enough to have a roof over my head, clean water, electricity, a computer, internet, and cable tv. But food was often harder to come by. This may seem like a contradiction, but when your mom has left to marry her uncle and your dad has schizophrenia, you aren’t really in charge of how the money is spent.
