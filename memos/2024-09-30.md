  - **Content**: Starting at the age of 12, I was given $20 a week for my food. (If it was a good week. Otherwise it might $10 or even $0). During the school year that meant I just had to make that stretch for dinner and the weekends — I had free school lunch. But in the summer, that made things quite a bit harder. One week, I had only a few jars of sprinkles left in the top of our pantry.
